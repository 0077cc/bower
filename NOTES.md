          - But then.. how would versions be handled here?? different versions might have changed the deps
    - Publish model
- Commands
    - Bower script x
         - post-install (only useful for moving files around)
         - pre-publish
         - etc
    - bower test
    - bower install & update
        - Ability to target specific commits and not only versions
            - But then, how would a version be guessed from it?!
            - It would be ok project wise, but if used within a reusable package, it must have a version!
        - Option to install deps in a tree structure like npm? see: https://github.com/twitter/bower/issues/157
        - Print a tree like npm with the deps
        - Allow overrides of the registry for easier fork integration? this need to be discussed as part of the spec, see: https://github.com/twitter/bower/issues/342

- Use yeomen insight!!
- Bower could setup a git hook on folders that are github repos to make validation of the json (if it conforms with the spec)
- In prod dont forget to Q.longStackJumpLimit = 0;
- Ddd perf tests
  - http://trace.gl
